# Notifications Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist provides a ready reference for when participants (FIPs, FIUs, AAs) should trigger notifications to their customers, and what the content of such notifications ought to be. The checklist aims to provide clarity for developers, commonality to customers with respect to when to expect notifications, and compliance assurance to businesses.

## Scope

The checklist lists the events that trigger notification responsibilities on different entities, the APIs of the technical standard that corresponds to such events, and the content that notifications must, at a minimum contain.

It does not prescribe the mode in which the notification feature has to be implemented - i.e. whether through an SMS sent to the registered mobile number of the customer, or through an email sent to the registered email ID of the customer, or through an in-app notification sent through the app that the customer accesses.

> Note: All API references are based on ReBIT V 1.1.2

The list of events is drawn from an appendix in a Draft Technical Specifications Document floated by ReBIT in 2019. This is a starting point and changes to this will be made based on feedback from contributors to this market guideline.
